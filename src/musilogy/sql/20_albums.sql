-- R3. Secondary types are empty or drawn from {Soundtrack, Demo}. The
-- +/-5-year window around y0 that used to gate this table is gone: y0 is now
-- partly derived from albums (30_bands_lifespan.sql), so it cannot be used
-- here without creating a cycle.
--
-- Demo is accepted: among the groups owning both a demo and a studio album,
-- 67.5% released the demo first, a median of 3 years earlier — a demo is
-- contemporaneous evidence of early activity.
-- Live stays excluded on purpose: MusicBrainz dates a live release by its
-- publication, not by the performance (710 bands carry a live release dated
-- more than 20 years after their last studio album; titles such as "Live in
-- Paris (1966)" published in 2024). DJ-mix, Compilation and Remix stay
-- excluded too. Both figures are contractual, in tests/test_baseline.py.
