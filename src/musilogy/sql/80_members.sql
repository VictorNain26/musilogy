-- Membership relations: the only temporal relational data the dump carries.
-- 80_ is the free slot after the table's only dependency (10_bands) and before
-- 90_, reserved for the invariants: appending here renumbers nothing.
--
-- person_mbid is an outward reference, like genre_parents.parent_mbid: this
-- pipeline extracts Group/Orchestra/Choir only, so the person it names is
-- never a local row and no invariant requires it to be one.
--
-- Years read with yr(), never a direct CAST: an illegible date ("????-01" on
-- five relations of the reference dump) becomes NULL rather than a guess, the
-- same R2 discipline as everywhere else. The relation itself survives — only
-- its unreadable edge is absent.
--
-- DISTINCT, not a plain projection: MusicBrainz emits one relation per set of
-- attributes, so the same person in the same band over the same period appears
-- once per instrument credited.
