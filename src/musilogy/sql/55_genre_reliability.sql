-- How much of a genre the multi-artist rule of 20_albums.sql destroys.
-- That rule (a release-group must be credited to exactly one distinct artist)
-- amputates genres very unevenly — on the reference dump it costs `classical`
-- 94.3% of its candidate release-groups against 0.6% for `alternative metal`
-- — so a density computed over a genre that loses most of its albums is not
-- comparable to any other. The rate is measured here and published on
-- `genres`; 60_density.sql then excludes on the measurement, never on a list
-- of genre names, which would be exactly the arbitrary judgment this replaces.
--
-- Candidates come from raw_release_groups, NOT from `albums`: `albums` has
-- already dropped the multi-artist release-groups, so the rate read there
-- would be zero by construction and the loss unrecoverable.
